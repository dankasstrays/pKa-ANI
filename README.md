# **PREREQUISITES:**

* miniconda/anaconda
* torch
* torchani
* ase
* pdbfixer (requires OpenMM 6.3 or later)

## Installations of prerequisites: 

### **1. TORCH and TORCHANI:**

https://aiqm.github.io/torchani/start.html

prior to the installation of torch and torchani user should make sure miniconda/anaconda is installed

```bash
pip install numpy
pip install --pre torch torchvision -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu100/torch_nightly.html
pip install torchani
```

### **2. ASE:**

https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/install.html

```bash
pip install --upgrade --user ase
```

or

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge ase
```

### **3. JOBLIB:**

https://joblib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installing.html

```bash
pip install joblib
```

or

```bash
conda install -c anaconda joblib
```

### **4. IF PDB PREPARATION IS GOING TO BE USED : OPENMM and PDBFIXER**

OPENMM: http://docs.openmm.org/latest/userguide/index.html

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge openmm
```		

PDBFIXER: https://github.com/openmm/pdbfixer

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge pdbfixer
```
		
# **USAGE**

## Example usages:

* If PDB file doesnt exist, it is downloaded and prepared for pKa calculations.

```bash
pkaani -i 1BNZ
      
pkaani -i 1BNZ.pdb
```

* Multiple files can be given as inputs

```bash
pkaani -i 1BNZ,1E8L
```

* If a specific directory is wanted:

```bash
pkaani -i path_to_file/1BNZ
      
pkaani -i path_to_file/1BNZ,path_to_file/1E8L
```

* If PDB file exist but not prepared for pKa calculations (no H atom added):

```bash
pkaani -i 1BNZ -p T
      
pkaani -i 1BNZ,1E8L -p True
```

## Arguments: 
  
             -i: Input files. Inputs can be given with or without
                 file extension (.pdb). If PDB file is under a
                 specific directory (or will be downloaded) the path
                 can also be given as path_to_file/PDBFILE.
                 Multiple PDB files can be given
                 by using "," as separator (i.e. pkaani -i 1BNZ,1E8L).

             -p: Prepare for pKa calculations. If value is set to
                 True, heteroatoms (except DNA and RNA)
                 are removed, missing atoms added,
                 and H atoms are added at pH=7 (default ionization states:
                 ASP, GLU, LYS, TYR, HID).
                 If the pdb file is not accessible and will be downloaded
                 from RCSB, its value is not taken into account.
                 Default value is False for accessible PDB files.
